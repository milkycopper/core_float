# core_float

This library is based on the **Rust Core Library** and aims to provide an identical set of APIs for **_f32_** and **_f64_** floating-point types.

With the help of this library, you can write identical code for both f32 and f64 types. And since the library is #![no_std], the calculation results can maintain cross platform consistency.
